# **CMPE 258 Assignment 4**

MNIST classifier with various training knobs using numpy and keras

### **Data :** 
Kaggle dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data </br>
The files train.csv and test.csv contains gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits 0 through 9.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

### **Objective :**
Designing a neural network on MNIST handwritten digit images to identify the number in the image.
The notebook is using numpy and keras to do the same without CNN.
